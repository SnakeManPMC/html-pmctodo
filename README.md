# html-pmctodo

PMC TODO task "website" using PHP + MySQL.

Very simple TODO task thingy to create, search, edit and delete TODO tasks. You can set category, priority and status (although these dont have other functionality than visual for now).

This is just for my private local web server use, there is no real web site stuff included and this is not meant to be real web site. Maybe in the future such things are added like proper html code etc.
